# Python_challenge
The Module 3 assignment was completed to assess the skills and understanding of Python using GitBash and GitHub.

## Working with GitHub remote/local
After creating new repository "python_challenge", clone repository to computer:

Inside repository create folders 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll', each containing folders 'Resources' and 'analysis' as well as a 'main.py' file.
It should appear as so:

## PyBank
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
*	The total number of months included in the dataset
*	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
*	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

**Your analysis should align with the following results:**

Financial Analysis

'----------------------------'

Total Months: 86

Total: $22564198

Average Change: $-8311.11

Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)

Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

## PyPoll
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

**Your analysis should align with the following results:**

Election Results

'-------------------------'

Total Votes: 369711

'-------------------------'

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)

Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
